            <h3>What is Quality Education?</h3>
            <div class="para w-75">
                Whatever progress our society has made over the centuries is because of education. Being the foundation
                stone of
                society, education brings reforms, helps in progress and paves way for innovation. The importance of
                quality
                education cannot be undermined in a society, which is why great personalities have extensively written
                on
                its
                need in a civilized society. It is because of education, that humans have been able to explore the
                vastness
                of
                the universe and the mystery of its existence in atoms. The concepts like gravity, cognitive dissonance,
                laser-guided surgical procedures and millions of more would not exist if education were not there to
                unleash
                our
                potential. In the 21st century, some countries are lagging in the race for quality education.

                informing, to the processing of information and the production of knowledge.

            <h3>Understanding Quality Education</h3>
            <div class="para w-75">
                Education International (EI), a Belgium-based organization, defines quality education as one that
                focuses on
                the
                social, emotional, mental, physical, and cognitive development of each student regardless of gender,
                race,
                ethnicity, socioeconomic status, or geographic location. It prepares the child for life and not just for
                testing. In 2012, the United Nations for the first time included ‘Quality Education’ in their
                Sustainable
                Development Goals (SDG). Further, education in modern times is highly influenced and dependent on
                Information
                and Communication Technology which has paved the way for students to attain school or higher-level
                education.
                Quality education not only prepares a student for a job but also develops the overall personality of an
                individual. In the case of children, it aims at their complete upbringing where morals and ethics are
                taught
                as
                part of the curriculum to help them live a healthy lifestyle.

            <h3>United Nations on Quality Education</h3>
            <div class="para w-75">The United Nations understand the supremacy of education for a brighter and
                prosperous
                future
                and is therefore of the consensus that quality education and not merely education should be a reality
                for
                all. In its Sustainable Development Goals, the UN has identified quality education as a major goal to
                ensure
                the ‘transformation of the world’ by 2030. By quality education, the UN implies equitable and standard
                education for all that will promote lifelong learning and the urge to gather knowledge. Inclusivity and
                equitability are the foundations to be upheld in quality education and not a greater literacy rate. This
                is
                a revolutionary approach to understanding education and making it the means of changing the world.

            <h3>Why is it Important?</h3>
            <div class="para w-75">We all are aware of how technology changing the face of education. Not only has the
                mode
                of
                receiving education changed but the methods of teaching students have also evolved. Earlier, education
                was
                more of a monologue, but nowadays, teachers encourage students to maintain a two-way flow of information
                in
                classrooms. United Nations has identified a multitude of problems at the global level that if not
                addressed
                can lead to serious problems. To tackle such issues, the need for leaders and experienced professionals
                who
                are adept in their respective fields has grown. To encourage leadership and power to influence among the
                students, it has become imperative to employ a refined way of teaching practices. In the age of
                technology,
                information can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Even though providing quality education demands
                great efforts to shape the personality of a student, with the advent of new technologies, a student is
                just
                a click away from requisite resources. While sitting hundreds of miles away from an educational
                institute,
                the students can take online classes from the institution, avail benefits of online career counselling,
                and
                access a great volume of resources from free online libraries.

            <div class="para w-75">In 2020, Covid-19 hit the world and education was one of the most important factors
                that
                were
                adversely affected. A majority of countries announced the temporary closure of schools impacting more
                than
                91% of students in the world.
                <br><br>
                As per the UN, by April 2020, approximately 1.6 billion students were out of school and nearly 369
                million
                children depend upon school meals. To ensure that education doesn’t stop at this time, UNESCO has
                created
                the following aims:

                    <li>Seek equitable solutions and universal access</li>
                    <li>Make sure that there are coordinated responses that avoid overlapping efforts</li>

                        school
                        and only 60% of young people will reach upper secondary education in 2030</li>
                    <li>More than half of the students that have not enrolled in school live in Sub-Saharan Africa</li>
                    <li>617 million youth worldwide lack basic mathematics and literacy skills</li>
                    <li>In 10 low and middle-income countries, children with disabilities were 19% less likely to
                        achieve
                        minimum proficiency in reading</li>

            <h3>How this Goal can be Achieved?</h3>
            <div class="para w-75">The increasing number of crimes, wars, disease outbreaks, drastic economic downfalls,
                climate
                change, and many other factors have led to unexpected changes in societies around the globe. Due to
                this,
                the educationists and developmental organizations around the world emphasize the need for quality
                education
                and are stressing the need and uniting people towards achieving the goal. From educating a smaller group
                of
                people within their community to spreading awareness about the rising global issues, the educated people
                can
                work in an array of ways to achieve the goals. Besides formulating new methods, traditional methods like
                employing drama and art in education can also yield optimum results and help in enriching the
                educational
                process.
